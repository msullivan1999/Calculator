# Calculator
- Simple online calculator using vanilla JavaScript, html, css and Bootstrap
- Run by opening the calc.html file (inside hmtl folder) in your browser

## Still to do:
- add the css
- consider removing use of "eval"
- extend funtionality(?)
- add error checks (e.g. can currently append to a number)
- add flag to check that first input after '=' is not an int
